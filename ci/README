This Docker container is the means by which to integrate custom calico/vpp 
testcases with the production calico CI test runs.

The custom testcases:
  * maglev
  * memif
  * hoststack/VCL
  * calico/vpp specific logs and data using "calivppctl export"

Run the container as follows:

sudo docker run -it -v "/tmp":"/root/results" \
     -v "/home/localadmin/aws":"/root/.aws" \
     -v "/home/localadmin/ci/ci_kubeconfig":"/root/kubeconfig" \
     onong/calivppctl:stable

The container needs three params:

  1. .aws folder with the credentials
	-v "/home/localadmin/aws":"/root/.aws"
  2. cluster kubeconfig
	-v "/home/localadmin/ci/ci_kubeconfig":"/root/kubeconfig"
  3. results dir to output results to
	-v "/tmp":"/root/results"
